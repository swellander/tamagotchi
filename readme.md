## Planning

1. Configuration/dependencies
    * _gulp_ - managing development tasks
    * _browserify_ - allow use of import/require statements
    * _vinyl-source-stream_ - mediate between Gulp and Browserify
    * _gulp-concat_ - concatenate files
    * _gulp-uglify_ - minify code for increased efficiency
    * _gulp-util_ - utility functions for gulp plugins
    * _del_ - help keep directories clean during development
    * _gulp-jshint_ keep me on my toes  

2. Specs
    * 
3. Integration
4. UX/UI
5. Polish
