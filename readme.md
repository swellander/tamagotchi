## Planning

1. Configuration/dependencies
    * **gulp** - managing development tasks
    * **browserify** - allow use of import/require statements
    * **vinyl-source-stream** - mediate between Gulp and Browserify
    * **gulp-concat** - concatenate files
    * **gulp-uglify** - minify code for increased efficiency
    * **gulp-util** - utility functions for gulp plugins
    * **del** - help keep directories clean during development
    * **gulp-jshint** keep me on my toes  

2. Specs

3. Integration
4. UX/UI
5. Polish
